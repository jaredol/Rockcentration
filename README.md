# Rockcentration

A rock-themed version of the classic memory game 'Concentration'.  A player flips over cars to reveal their hidden backside. Find each card's pair in the shortest steps possible.

Still a work in progress. Some things I would like to implement inlcude

*  a dual player feature
*  high score display (using local storage)
